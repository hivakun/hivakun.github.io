Finally, the **WText** project is completed and ready for use. =)

If you have tried to create a wiki page dynamically from a Java application, you may have been faced with the lack of libraries for document handling in _Mediawiki_ format.

As I passed by this problem, I decided to create an opensource project to contribute to the Java comunicade and try to facilitate the creation of _Mediawiki_ documents.

This project aims to make the task of creating and writing wiki documents in Java much easier.

To do this, this library encapsulates a set of elements, commonly used in wiki pages (such as paragraphs, tables, source code, links and lists) and represents these elements into classes, allowing easy handling of these elements by Java developers without having to work with the wiki markup language.

Interested? Take a look at [WText Project](https://github.com/hivakun/wtext) on _GitHub_.
